ORIGINAL NOTES, ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND COPYRIGHT NOTICE
====================================================

This drawing is not intended for scale modelling and was drawn as a general arrangement guide to the Titanic's interiors. Interior fittings are not necessarily to scale.  
References for this drawing include, but are not limited to, many of the original Harland & Wolff deck plans and general arrangement plans, original 1st class passenger plans of Titanic, survivor accounts, RMS Olympic general arrangement plans from 1912 to 1933 and 1st and 2nd class passenger plans, the auction catalogue of Olympic's fittings from 1935, period photographs, wreck footage and most importantly the plans issued by Harland & Wolff, showing the general arrangements of Titanic as she left Southampton, used in the 1915 Limitation of Liability hearings.

Special thanks to the Trustees of the Titanic Research and Modelling Association and individually to Scott Andrews for his expertise in the propulsion and auxiliary systems of the Titanic, Daniel Klistorner who advised on the arrangements of internal fittings, Peter Davies-Garner and Ray Lepien who provided copies of some of the much-needed research materials.
