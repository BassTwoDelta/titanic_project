                <img src="/static/img/third_class/Poop_Deck.jpg" alt="Poop Deck" width="80%">
                <p>The Poop Deck was the aftermost part of the RMS Titanic. The Third Class passengers didn't have a real promenade, but the Poop Deck served as one.</p>
                <h4>Second Class Smoke Room</h4>
                <p>The Second Class Smoking Room was located on B Deck, just above the Second Class Library. It had green leather arm chairs and oak paneling. It was for male passengers only, and they talked about politics, drank rum, whisky or brandy while they played cards. The room was decorated in the Louis XVI style and the furniture was upholstered in deep green Moroccan leather.</p>

                <h3>B-Deck Middle</h3>
                <h4>First Class</h4>
                <p>B Deck, also called the Bridge Deck, was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. It was the third of nine decks on the Titanic. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here, with six palatial cabins featuring their own private promenades.</p>
                <h4>First Class Parlor Suites</h4>
                <p>The most splendid First-Class accommodation on both the Titanic and the Olympic were the four parlour suites, two each on B and C Decks, just aft of the forward Grand Staircase landings. The two on B Deck were advertised at "Deluxe" Parlour Suites, or Promenade Suites because they each contained a 50 ft (15.24 M.) private promenade deck. The promenade deck connected to the First-Class gangway entrances immediately forward, enabling the copious amounts of luggage usually carried by the Titanic's richest passengers to be loaded directly into their suites. The Parlour Suites each comprised two large bedrooms, two walk-in wardrobes, a private bathroom, a lavatory, and a spacious sitting room. The sitting rooms were lavish rooms that allowed for receiving small parties of guests. Each featured a faux fireplace, large card table, plush sofas and chairs, sideboards, and writing desks.
                The two private promenade decks were unique to the Titanic, decorated in half-timber Tudor style panelling, wicker deck chairs, sofas, table,s and potted plants. The deck chairs were cane, made by Dryad of Leicester. The chairman of the White Star Line, J. Bruce Ismay, occupied the port-side "Deluxe" Suite on the Titanic, while the starboard suite was occupied by the American millionairess Mrs. Charlotte Drake Cardeza, her son, and entourage.</p>

                <h4>First Class Restraunts</h4>
                <p>On Titanic, the A La Carte Restaurant and the Caf√© Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; nearly all were lost in the disaster because they weren't considered crew members, and they, of course, weren't passengers. The very few staff members who did survive were allowed on deck because they were coincidentally wearing casual clothes and the officers thought them to be passengers.</p>

                <h3>B-Deck Forward</h3>
                <h4>First Class Cabins</h4>
                <p>First-Class accommodation occupied almost the entirety of B and C Decks, but also large sections forward on A, D and E-Decks; a handful of First-Class cabins were located on the Boat Deck between the forward Grand Staircase and Officer's Quarters. On E-Deck staterooms and cabins were interchangeable between First and Second-Class, meaning sections could be prioritized for either one of the classes in the event of overbooking or high demand. Only the starboard side of E-Deck belonged to First/Second-Class, the whole of the Port side contained Third-Class and Crew cabins. The First-Class corridors were in general very spartan in appearance, but the B and C Deck passageways which accessed the very finest staterooms were more impressive. These featured white-painted 'Venesta' panels (a durable type of plywood), pilasters, archways over the stateroom entrances, and a decorative frieze supported by gilt brackets running along the top of the walls which concealed the ventilation ducts and electrical wiring underneath. There were no handrails, no carpet runners, and lighting was provided by ormolu and cut-glass ceiling fixtures. On B Deck the two parallel corridors were enclosed by swinging baize-upholstered doors with louver panels, which muffled the sound coming from the stairwells and busy public rooms.</p>
